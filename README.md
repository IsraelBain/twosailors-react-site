Two Sailors Bartending Website 🍸

Welcome to the official website for Two Sailors Bartending!
This project was built to showcase bartending services, provide event booking options, and feature the latest cocktail creations & event highlights.

👨‍💻 About the Developer

Hi, I’m Israel Bain, a Computer Science student at Dalhousie University with a passion for web development.
I designed and built this website to create a seamless and modern user experience for Two Sailors Bartending, a business I co-founded with Drew Sailor.

We met while working together and quickly realized bartending is not just a job—it’s an art.
With a passion for crafting cocktails, entertaining guests, and bringing events to life, we started this business to serve Halifax & Eastern Canada.
