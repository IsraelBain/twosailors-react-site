# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Requirements

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Add your Google Maps API key to `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- [ ] Enable "Places API" in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Set up API key restrictions (HTTP referrers for production domain)
- [ ] Restart dev server after env changes

### 2. Google Maps API Cost Optimization âœ…
- [x] **AutocompleteSessionToken implemented** - Reduces API costs from ~$0.017/keystroke to $0.017/session
- [x] **Session lifecycle management** - Token created on focus, reused until selection
- [x] **Proper session cleanup** - Token reset after place selection

### 3. Production Optimizations âœ…
- [x] **Conditional logging** - Console logs only in development
- [x] **Error handling** - API key validation and script loading failures
- [x] **Network resilience** - Graceful degradation for slow connections

### 4. Final Verification
- [ ] Test form submission with places autocomplete
- [ ] Verify travel fee calculation (should be > $0 for non-Halifax locations)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (responsive design)
- [ ] Test with slow network conditions
- [ ] Verify all animations and popups still work
- [ ] Test EmailJS integration with real email

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected API Costs
With session tokens properly implemented:
- **Cost per user session**: ~$0.017 (regardless of keystrokes)
- **Monthly cost estimate**: $5-50 depending on traffic
- **Without session tokens**: Could be 10-50x higher

## ðŸ”§ Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development
npm start

# Production build
npm run build

# Deploy (depends on your hosting)
# Netlify: Drag build folder to netlify.com
# Vercel: vercel --prod
# AWS S3: aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket
```

## ðŸš¨ Critical Settings
- **Google API Key**: Must have Places API enabled
- **CORS/Referrers**: Configure for your production domain
- **EmailJS**: Verify service keys are correct for production

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing
The form is responsive, but test these specifically:
- Places autocomplete on mobile keyboards  
- Touch/tap interactions with suggestions
- Form validation error messages
- Animation performance on slower devices
